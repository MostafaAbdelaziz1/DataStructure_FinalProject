# Bank Management System


This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows administrators and clients to perform different banking operations.

The code is fully OOP-based which uses a combination of doubly linked list and a priority queue to manage the clientsâ€™ bank information and their feedback efficiently. Linked list is used to maintain a list of clients, while the priority queue stores ratings less than 6 out of 10 in the ascending order. 

In conclusion, this project provides a basic banking management system that performs various banking operation.
