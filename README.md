# DataStructure_FinalProject

This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows administrators and clients to perform different banking operations.

The code is fully OOP-based which uses a combination of linked lists and a binary search tree to manage the clients efficiently. Linked lists are used to maintain a list of clients, while the BST  allows for efficient searching and retrieval of clients based on their ID.
